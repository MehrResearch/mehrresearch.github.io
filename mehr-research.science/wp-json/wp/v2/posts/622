I\u2019m really grateful for having the opportunity of sharing science, time and passion in Mehr research group at the Advance Research Center (ARC) of the University of Glasgow. I got in touch with Hessam Mehr after he came to Pamplona to visit our laboratory (<a href=\"https:\/\/upnalab.com\/\">UPNALAB<\/a>). I was later invited to an <a href=\"https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/2024\/a-sounding-board-for-future-chemistry-sound-chemistry-retrospect\/\">acoustic chemistry workshop<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/sounds-chemistry.science\">at Glasgow<\/a> where I could present my research work of the past years. After that, I got on board into this lovely journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/IMG_4263-scaled-e1716571230242.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-629\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The UPNALAB crew wowed Hessam with their fascinating research projects last year.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This experience will be crucial not only for my personal career but also for developing my transversal skills, such as, multicultural communication or networking. Here in the ARC there are researcher from many different countries all around the world with whom I\u2019m always enjoying good conversations. \u00a0My current main interests are in human computer interaction and contactless haptics and I\u2019m willing to spread my maker and technical knowledge among this laboratory family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"384\" height=\"287\" src=\"https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/image.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-627\" style=\"width:484px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/image.jpg 384w, https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/image-300x224.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Josu busy with experiments in the lab.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking black coffee with hot milk in a glass with ice cubes is my favourite activity when sited on a terrace surrounded by friends and sunny nice day. You can find me hiking the highest mountains of Scotland or visiting the mysterious lakes and islands around. Sometime I like to stop for local beer and food or trying to pronounce right the Scottish accent with words like \u201cHiya\u201d, \u201cAwright\u201d, \u201cWee\u201d, \u201cHapnin\u201d or \u201cEdinbruh\u201d. The climate isn\u2019t the best, although since I\u2019m here it is mainly sunny. They say that I have brought the good weather somehow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a1Hasta la vista!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are delighted to welcome Josu to the group.
