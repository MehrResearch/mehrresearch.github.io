My main focus was on alkali metal catalysis and photo-induced phase change energy storage dyes, primarily using solvent-based methods to synthesize reactants and explore their reaction mechanisms\u2014 a process that was quite &#8220;traditional&#8221;. When I joined Hessam&#8217;s lab, I encountered parallel aerosol reactors for the first time. I was amazed by this novel method of synthesis and decided to experiment with synthesizing known compounds using the aerosol reactor to test its potential in compound synthesis. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the exceptionally high surface area to volume ratio of droplets in aerosols, substances can more rapidly interact with the heat source or reaction environment, thereby accelerating heat transfer and reaction rates. This means that chemical reactions can be effectively promoted even at lower temperatures. In addition, the evaporation of the solvent is an endothermic process, which allows the aerosol droplets to locally increase their temperature during evaporation without the need for an external heat source. These properties make aerosol methods particularly suitable for synthesis reactions that require mild heating or low thermal initiation.For instance, in the synthesis of macrocyclic Schiff bases from aldehydes\/ketones and amines, the dehydration step involved not only stabilizes the product by forming double bonds but also releases heat, providing the necessary activation energy for the reaction. This is beneficial for synthesizing longer chains or even [3+3] type macrocyclic Schiff bases. Consequently, we chose macrocyclic Schiff bases as our target products for synthesis. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a Schiff base\uff1f<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Schiff bases are a type of chemical compound that often come up in organic chemistry. They\u2019re made when an amine (that\u2019s a molecule containing nitrogen bonded to three different organic groups) reacts with an aldehyde or ketone (these are types of compounds that have a carbonyl (C=O) group, which includes a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom). When they react, they form a new compound called an imine or Schiff base featuring a double bond between a nitrogen and a carbon atom. This reaction is pretty simple but super important because Schiff bases can be used in lots of different ways, like in dyes, pigments, and even some medicines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Macrocyclic Schiff bases are like the bigger, more complex cousins of regular Schiff bases. The &#8220;macro&#8221; part of the name means large, and &#8220;cyclic&#8221; means ring-shaped, so these are large ring-shaped molecules. They also have the characteristic nitrogen-to-carbon double bond, just like regular Schiff bases. What makes them special is their size and structure, which allow them to form very stable complexes with metals. This makes them useful in more advanced applications, like catalysis (which helps speed up chemical reactions), or in creating materials that can grab and hold onto specific molecules, a bit like how a lock holds a key. This can be really handy in areas like environmental science, where you might want to capture pollutants, or in medicine, for delivering drugs to specific parts of the body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"850\" src=\"https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Macrocyclic-with-Zn-1024x850.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-819\" style=\"width:620px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Macrocyclic-with-Zn-1024x850.png 1024w, https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Macrocyclic-with-Zn-300x249.png 300w, https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Macrocyclic-with-Zn-768x637.png 768w, https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Macrocyclic-with-Zn.png 1092w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Metals captured in a Schiff base macrocycle.

This method stands out compared to traditional solution-based approaches for several reasons. First, the reactants in aerosol form have a much larger surface area, which may speeds up reactions and increases their progress towards completion. This makes aerosol synthesis particularly suitable for chemical reactions that require fast reactivity and high yield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major advantage of aerosol synthesis is its environmental friendliness. Traditional chemical synthesis often involves large amounts of organic solvents, which are not only costly but also pose significant environmental risks. Aerosol technology can significantly reduce or even eliminate the use of solvents, thereby lowering environmental impact and reducing energy consumption. For instance, in the production of nanomaterials, aerosol methods can avoid the use of organic solvents at high temperatures, reducing the emission of harmful substances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"866\" height=\"1058\" src=\"https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/reactor-new.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-815\" style=\"width:336px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/reactor-new.png 866w, https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/reactor-new-246x300.png 246w, https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/reactor-new-838x1024.png 838w, https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/reactor-new-768x938.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">This is our aerosol reactor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its many benefits, aerosol synthesis does have some limitations. For example, it requires specialized equipment to generate and control aerosol particles, which means higher technical requirements and initial investments. Additionally, maintaining the stability of aerosols and precisely controlling particle size are technical challenges that need to be addressed in experiments. However, with ongoing technological advancements and further research, aerosol synthesis is showing tremendous potential in fields like pharmaceuticals, catalyst fabrication, and high-performance materials synthesis. As technology continues to advance, it is expected that aerosol synthesis will play an increasingly important role in chemical manufacturing, especially in an era that emphasizes green and sustainable chemical processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How did we approach the problem?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We started by searching for reaction formulas related to the synthesis of macrocyclic Schiff bases using the traditional bulk solution method, selecting reaction systems that are mild, with temperatures slightly above or equal to room temperature. Next, we replicate these reactions using the original published protocol to make sure they are reproducible. Once verified successfully, we then attempt to synthesize the macrocyclic Schiff bases using aerosol synthesis in our aerosol reactor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"677\" height=\"552\" src=\"https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-814\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/image-1.png 677w, https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/image-1-300x245.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Simplified representation of an aerosol reactor<em>.<\/em> A piezoelectric actuator (a) is used to turn the reactants in the glass vials into aerosol droplets.

They&#8217;re popular because they can create a fine mist without using heat, making them efficient and safe for delicate liquids.<\/p>\n<\/details>\n\n\n\n<p>By positioning the vials at a slight angle relative to each other, we encouraged microdroplets from each source to collide with each other to form the Schiff base.

Therefore, we can use infrared spectroscopy to detect functional groups in the product and look for the (-C=N-) absorption peak, which indicates the presence of the imine bond. After calculating the theoretical molecular weight of the target product, we also used mass spectrometry to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of the reaction product, from which we can infer the actual mass of the product. By comparing the measured mass with the calculated mass, we can verify whether the molecule obtained is the target product. These steps help us to get a better idea of which product molecules have formed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>What is infrared spectroscopy?<\/summary>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/image-9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-785\" style=\"width:620px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/image-9.png 800w, https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/image-9-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/mehr-research.science\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/image-9-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">IR Spectroscopy Instrumentation principle <br>Picture source(<a href=\"https:\/\/byjus.com\/chemistry\/infrared-spectroscopy\/\">https:\/\/byjus.com\/chemistry\/infrared-spectroscopy\/<\/a>)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Infrared spectroscopy (IR) is a practical chemical analysis technique that identifies and studies chemical substances by measuring specific frequencies at which compounds absorb infrared light.
