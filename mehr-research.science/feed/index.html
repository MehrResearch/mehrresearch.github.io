<p class="has-custom-hessam-gradient-background has-background" style="border-radius:8px"><strong>Read it here: </strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D4DD00139G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In situ synthesis within micron-sized hydrogel reactors created via programmable aerosol chemistry</a> (open-access) Zhang, L.; Mehr, S. H. M., <em>RSC Digital Discovery</em>, <strong>2024</strong>. Now, also <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/dd/d4dd90049a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured on the front cover</a> of <em>Digital Discovery</em>&#8216;s December 2024 issue.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve just had our latest paper published in <em><a href="https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/digital-discovery/">RSC Digital Discovery</a></em>! This is the result of Luokun&#8217;s brief but very productive internship in the group last year (<a href="https://mehr-research.science/2024/crafting-next-generation-reaction-containers-out-of-mists-of-tiny-particles/" data-type="post" data-id="280">separate blog post</a> about his experience in the group). Luckily for us, Luokun has been offered a PhD position and will be staying with us, so plenty more cool science to look forward to!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s this paper really about?</h2>



<p>One of our guiding principles in the group is that realising the full potential of digitisation requires a fresh look not just at what reacts with what, but also where this happens and what else is around. Nature is the master of surrounding reactivity with the right environment: just look at enzymes and how their active sites/prosthetic groups are nestled within a much larger structure; or how hopelessly impossible it seems for cellular processes to continue without the cell&#8217;s many membranes and modes of compartmentalising its activities. Containers can be smart — instead of being totally impermeable they can let certain things in/out but keep other from entering or leaving. And they don&#8217;t always have to be large like traditional glass containers in chemistry. In fact, for permeable containers being small allows molecules to reach the interior via diffusion (their random jittery movement), do something exciting, and then either leave or accumulate and build up like pearls in an oyster!</p>

<p>Our digital aerosol reactor, built entirely in-house, provides a way to produce millions of tiny chemical droplets and study their reactions. Digitizing our aerosol setup means tiny chemical &#8220;packets&#8221; can be released according to a computer program with very precise control over when and how much solution is sprayed. Our paper binds this progress with a way to turn these tiny liquid droplets into something more like a primitive cell. For this, we take advantage of gel-formation between alginate — a large molecule derived from seaweed — and calcium ions. This way, not only can we generate tiny hydrogel particles, but use them as tiny reactors by preloading them with reactive compounds.</p>

<p>Hello curious friends! I&#8217;m Chen Junyi, currently a graduate student specializing in Advanced Functional Materials at the University of Glasgow. Today, I want to take you on an exciting journey into the microscopic world of materials science, where tiny particles create big wonders! This adventure began with my post-graduate project, and now I’m thrilled to share it with you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are COFs and MOFs?</strong></h2>



<p>Imagine building a miniature city, not with bricks and mortar, but with molecules! This is what we explore in research, using <strong>Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs)</strong> and <strong>Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</strong>. These aren&#8217;t just ordinary materials, but super materials that can help clean the environment, store gases, or even deliver drugs precisely where they&#8217;re needed in the body.</p>



<p>COFs and MOFs are made by connecting molecules into a repeating 3D pattern, kind of like constructing a giant crystal lattice but on a nanoscale. These materials are super porous, meaning they have lots of tiny holes that can capture or release other molecules. This makes them incredibly useful for a wide range of applications!</p>



<p>So, what is the difference between <strong>COFs</strong> and <strong>MOFs</strong>? Although both are composed of molecules connected in a repeating 3D pattern, the main differences lie in their composition and the way they are linked:</p>



<p><strong>COFs :</strong> These are made entirely of light elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc., and are interconnected through covalent bonds (strong connections like the ones between hydrogen and oxygen in water molecules). This material is very stable and difficult to break down.</p>



<p><strong>MOFs :</strong> These contain metal ions and organic ligands (molecules that help arrange the metal ions), linked via coordination bonds (a more flexible type of connection). This allows MOFs to have many different structures and a broader range of uses.</p>



<p>In short, if you think of them as buildings, COFs are like constructions made with one type of sturdy brick, while MOFs are built with a variety of materials, including some metal components, allowing for more complex structures. This makes MOFs more flexible in adjusting and optimizing their performance.</p>

<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>What does SBU mean?</summary>
<p>SBU (Secondary Building Unit) refers to the fundamental building blocks in COFs (Covalent Organic Frameworks) and MOFs (Metal-Organic Frameworks), typically consisting of metal ions or clusters coordinated with organic ligands to create porous structures.</p>
</details>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do we make these materials</strong>?</h2>



<p>Creating COFs and MOFs can be tricky. Traditional methods are like slow cooking; they take a lot of time and energy. But under the guidance of my mentor, Dr. Hessam Mehr, we use something called an <strong>aerosol reactor</strong>. This reactor is like a magic box that allows us to create these materials faster and with less waste, which is great for the environment!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="644" height="442" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-858" style="width:488px;height:auto" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png 644w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3-300x206.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Design of the aerosol reactor used in my project. Control and activation components including Raspberry Pi Pico and atomiser driver circuit (left). Deposition area with piezoelectric atomisers and glass slides (right).</figcaption></figure>



<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>What does Piezoelectric atomiser means?</summary>
<p>Piezoelectric atomisers use the piezoelectric effect to generate ultrasonic vibrations, which rapidly transform a liquid into a fine mist or aerosol. These devices are commonly used in applications ranging from medical nebulizers to fragrance diffusers, leveraging their ability to produce fine, consistent particles without heat.</p>
</details>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s special about an aerosol reactor?</strong></h2>



<p>An aerosol reactor works by spraying tiny droplets or particles through a mist, which then transform into COFs or MOFs. Think of it as using a spray paint can to create a detailed mural. Each droplet has all the ingredients needed to form our materials, and when they meet, they stick together in just the right way.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="587" height="460" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-862" style="width:399px;height:auto" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4.png 587w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4-300x235.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Schematic diagram of aerosol reactor operation.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This method is not only quick but also very efficient. It allows us to experiment with different recipes for making COFs and MOFs, tweaking the process until we get the best possible material for a specific job, like finding the best ingredients for a super cake.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why does this matter?</strong></h2>



<p>You might wonder, why should we care about these tiny materials? Well, they could be game-changers in many fields. For example, they could capture harmful gases from the air or help store renewable energy more efficiently. They might even be used in medical treatments to deliver drugs precisely where they are needed, minimizing side effects.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="790" height="298" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-863" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5.png 790w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5-300x113.png 300w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5-768x290.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SEM image of IRMOF-2 synthesized using an aerosol reactor. The complex porous structure is widely used.</figcaption></figure>



<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary>What does SEM means?</summary>
<p>A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is a high-resolution microscope that utilizes an electron beam to scan the surface of a specimen, creating images that reveal the surface topography and composition of materials. SEM is extensively used in fields such as materials science, biology, and industrial inspection, providing detailed insights at the nano to micro scale.</p>
</details>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The future is bright!</strong></h2>



<p>Research in this field is like being both a magician and a scientist. Every day, we discover more about what these tiny structures can do and how they can help us solve some of the world’s big problems.</p>



<p>I hope this brief introduction to the world of COFs and MOFs has sparked your curiosity. Perhaps one day, you&#8217;ll join us in the lab to discover even more materials that can make the world a better place. Until then, keep wondering, asking questions, and exploring the world around you.</p>

<p>The summer of 2024 was our busiest and most exciting by far. A lot of wonderful people joined the group; a few have already left and some are already thinking about coming back. Read on for a sneak peek at what we&#8217;ve been up to and the faces behind all the action.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">New faces in materials innovation</h3>



<p><strong>Luokun Zhang</strong>, former group intern returned to the group, along with two new faces, <strong>Zehua Li</strong> and <strong>Junyi Chen</strong> to complete their practical post-graduate project in advanced functional materials. Always the patient and methodical experimenter, Luokun trialled quite a few project ideas in his first couple of weeks before finally settling on generation of composite materials. Along the way, we had to build our own microscope, for which Luokun designed 3D-printed a sample stage. We both learned a lot about optics, thanks to <strong>Abhishek Sharma</strong> and <strong>Ilya Starshynov</strong> who held our hand in the process. Zehua and Junyi both explored Schiff bases this summer, using them to assemble large molecules and new materials inside our prototype aerosol reactor.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Antimicrobial resistance</h3>



<p>For the first time, this year we hosted a Chemical Biology post-graduate student. <strong>Zixi Wu</strong> took a brave leap aboard an ambitious project where we looked into the feasibility of generating a diverse range potential new antimicrobials by exposing existing antibiotics to reactive conditions within our aerosol system. Zixi deserves extra kudos for keeping his cool on a project with many layers of unknowns. His early results pave the way for future students taking on this challenge.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">From Georgia to Scotland</h3>



<p><strong>Mariam Kalathil</strong> visited us from warm Georgia, US as part of the Arcadia summer exchange programme. Despite never having taken courses in organic chemistry or electronics, she excelled in her project, building a one-of-a-kind experimental setup to answer a fundamental chemistry question. The goal of Mariam&#8217;s project was to find out whether the messiest chemical mixtures also produced the largest number of new chemical compounds.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="saad-project">Building in the workshop</h3>



<p>Talented and extremely keen Nuffield placement student <strong>Saad Azad</strong> was busy building a motorised XY stage out of old CD/DVD drives! Saad had to pull these drives out of dead computers in electronics recycling, and control the motor moving the laser back and forth using an Arduino program. These types of stages are useful in microscopy, where they are used to scan different parts of a sample automatically.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Invisible hands</h3>



<p><a href="https://upnalab.com/">UpnaLab</a> Phd student <strong>Josu Irisarri</strong> spent this summer in Glasgow looking at ways to control chemical droplets using sound. We tried too many mad experiments to list here but one nice Friday found a quick zap of sonic energy could extract little droplets off the surface of a petri dish of water, bringing us a step closer to the tantalising future of contact-free chemistry. </p>

<p>During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong interest in organic chemistry. My main focus was on alkali metal catalysis and photo-induced phase change energy storage dyes, primarily using solvent-based methods to synthesize reactants and explore their reaction mechanisms— a process that was quite &#8220;traditional&#8221;. When I joined Hessam&#8217;s lab, I encountered parallel aerosol reactors for the first time. I was amazed by this novel method of synthesis and decided to experiment with synthesizing known compounds using the aerosol reactor to test its potential in compound synthesis. </p>



<p>Due to the exceptionally high surface area to volume ratio of droplets in aerosols, substances can more rapidly interact with the heat source or reaction environment, thereby accelerating heat transfer and reaction rates. This means that chemical reactions can be effectively promoted even at lower temperatures. In addition, the evaporation of the solvent is an endothermic process, which allows the aerosol droplets to locally increase their temperature during evaporation without the need for an external heat source. These properties make aerosol methods particularly suitable for synthesis reactions that require mild heating or low thermal initiation.For instance, in the synthesis of macrocyclic Schiff bases from aldehydes/ketones and amines, the dehydration step involved not only stabilizes the product by forming double bonds but also releases heat, providing the necessary activation energy for the reaction. This is beneficial for synthesizing longer chains or even [3+3] type macrocyclic Schiff bases. Consequently, we chose macrocyclic Schiff bases as our target products for synthesis. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a Schiff base？</h2>



<p>Schiff bases are a type of chemical compound that often come up in organic chemistry. They’re made when an amine (that’s a molecule containing nitrogen bonded to three different organic groups) reacts with an aldehyde or ketone (these are types of compounds that have a carbonyl (C=O) group, which includes a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom). When they react, they form a new compound called an imine or Schiff base featuring a double bond between a nitrogen and a carbon atom. This reaction is pretty simple but super important because Schiff bases can be used in lots of different ways, like in dyes, pigments, and even some medicines.</p>



<p>Macrocyclic Schiff bases are like the bigger, more complex cousins of regular Schiff bases. The &#8220;macro&#8221; part of the name means large, and &#8220;cyclic&#8221; means ring-shaped, so these are large ring-shaped molecules. They also have the characteristic nitrogen-to-carbon double bond, just like regular Schiff bases. What makes them special is their size and structure, which allow them to form very stable complexes with metals. This makes them useful in more advanced applications, like catalysis (which helps speed up chemical reactions), or in creating materials that can grab and hold onto specific molecules, a bit like how a lock holds a key. This can be really handy in areas like environmental science, where you might want to capture pollutants, or in medicine, for delivering drugs to specific parts of the body.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are aerosols and why use them in our experiments?</h2>



<p>Aerosol synthesis is an innovative chemical synthesis technique that suspends reactants as extremely fine particles in a gas, with the goal of enhancing reaction efficiency and product quality. This method stands out compared to traditional solution-based approaches for several reasons. First, the reactants in aerosol form have a much larger surface area, which may speeds up reactions and increases their progress towards completion. This makes aerosol synthesis particularly suitable for chemical reactions that require fast reactivity and high yield.</p>



<p>Another major advantage of aerosol synthesis is its environmental friendliness. Traditional chemical synthesis often involves large amounts of organic solvents, which are not only costly but also pose significant environmental risks. Aerosol technology can significantly reduce or even eliminate the use of solvents, thereby lowering environmental impact and reducing energy consumption. For instance, in the production of nanomaterials, aerosol methods can avoid the use of organic solvents at high temperatures, reducing the emission of harmful substances.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="866" height="1058" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/reactor-new.png" alt="" class="wp-image-815" style="width:336px;height:auto" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/reactor-new.png 866w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/reactor-new-246x300.png 246w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/reactor-new-838x1024.png 838w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/reactor-new-768x938.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is our aerosol reactor</figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite its many benefits, aerosol synthesis does have some limitations. For example, it requires specialized equipment to generate and control aerosol particles, which means higher technical requirements and initial investments. Additionally, maintaining the stability of aerosols and precisely controlling particle size are technical challenges that need to be addressed in experiments. However, with ongoing technological advancements and further research, aerosol synthesis is showing tremendous potential in fields like pharmaceuticals, catalyst fabrication, and high-performance materials synthesis. As technology continues to advance, it is expected that aerosol synthesis will play an increasingly important role in chemical manufacturing, especially in an era that emphasizes green and sustainable chemical processes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How did we approach the problem?</h2>



<p>We started by searching for reaction formulas related to the synthesis of macrocyclic Schiff bases using the traditional bulk solution method, selecting reaction systems that are mild, with temperatures slightly above or equal to room temperature. Next, we replicate these reactions using the original published protocol to make sure they are reproducible. Once verified successfully, we then attempt to synthesize the macrocyclic Schiff bases using aerosol synthesis in our aerosol reactor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="677" height="552" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-814" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png 677w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-300x245.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Simplified representation of an aerosol reactor<em>.</em> A piezoelectric actuator (a) is used to turn the reactants in the glass vials into aerosol droplets. A cotton wick (b) connects the piezoelectric atomizer to the solvent. Products are collected on a glass slide.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To create macrocyclic Schiff bases using an aerosol reactor, we prepared two reagent vials. In one, we dissolved the amine in solvent; in the other, we dissolved aldehyde also in solvent. We also added a small amount of acid to the aldehyde mixture because acid can speed up or <em>catalyze </em>Schiff base formation.</p>



<p>Next, we fitted each reagent vial with a piezoelectric element, whose role is to convert the solution into a mist of aerosol particles, and placed the vial assembly inside the aerosol reactor. Finally, we connected the reactor to a computer which is programmed to control the emission aerosol by activating the piezoelectric elements.</p>

<p>A piezoelectric atomizer is a small device that uses quick vibrations to turn liquids into a fine mist. It works by using a special material that vibrates rapidly when electricity is applied, creating pressure waves that break the liquid into tiny droplets. You can find these atomizers in everyday items like humidifiers, which add moisture to the air, aroma diffusers, which spread essential oils, and medical devices like nebulizers, which help people inhale medicine. They&#8217;re popular because they can create a fine mist without using heat, making them efficient and safe for delicate liquids.</p>
</details>



<p>By positioning the vials at a slight angle relative to each other, we encouraged microdroplets from each source to collide with each other to form the Schiff base.  We collected the products of aerosol reaction on two glass slides within the reactor, one at the top and one at the bottom. This setup allowed us to capture and analyze the products separated afterwards.</p>

<p>After the Schiff base reaction is completed, the amine (-NH2) and aldehyde (-C=O) groups undergo a condensation reaction to form an imine bond (-C=N-). Therefore, we can use infrared spectroscopy to detect functional groups in the product and look for the (-C=N-) absorption peak, which indicates the presence of the imine bond. After calculating the theoretical molecular weight of the target product, we also used mass spectrometry to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of the reaction product, from which we can infer the actual mass of the product. By comparing the measured mass with the calculated mass, we can verify whether the molecule obtained is the target product. These steps help us to get a better idea of which product molecules have formed.</p>

<p>Infrared spectroscopy (IR) is a practical chemical analysis technique that identifies and studies chemical substances by measuring specific frequencies at which compounds absorb infrared light. Each chemical has its unique &#8220;molecular fingerprint,&#8221; consisting of a series of specific absorption peaks that reflect the vibrations of chemical bonds within the molecule. This technique allows us to quickly determine the type and molecular structure of substances and is widely used in research, quality control, and environmental monitoring. The advantages of IR spectroscopy include its speed and non-destructive nature, providing accurate chemical information without damaging the sample.</p>

<p>Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique used to identify compounds and measure their abundance by analyzing the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of sample molecules. In this process, the sample is first ionized to create charged particles, which are then accelerated in an electromagnetic field and separated based on their mass-to-charge ratios. A mass spectrometer generates a spectrum by detecting these separated ions, showing the distribution of ions with different m/z values, which helps to identify the chemical substances and their structures within the sample.</p>



<p>The applications of mass spectrometry are vast and include drug development, biological research, environmental science, and forensic science. The main advantages of this technique are its high sensitivity and the ability to detect trace amounts of substances, providing precise molecular mass information. Mass spectrometry can also analyze multiple components in complex samples, making it an indispensable tool in modern analytical science.</p>

We noticed some Schiff bases in the mass spectra, but it seemed that the reaction time was not enough for the full macrocycle to be assembled.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Future plan</h2>



<p>This study primarily showcases an innovative synthesis technique—using aerosol chemistry to manufacture macrocyclic Schiff bases. Although macrocyclic Schiff bases themselves have been extensively studied, the highlight of this research is the development of a brand new method of preparation. This method, which synthesizes through the collision of micron-sized aerosol droplets, not only enhances synthesis efficiency but also reduces environmental impact, offering a sustainable and efficient option for the field of chemical manufacturing.</p>



<p>In the future, we can focus on further refining this technology by introducing electrodes to enhance interactions between aerosol droplets using electrostatic forces to improve the success rate of reactions. Additionally, adjusting the boiling point of solvents and precisely controlling reaction temperatures will enhance reactivity and reduce unwanted side reactions, increasing the quality and yield of products.</p>



<p>These improvements will not only provide an opportunity to deeply understand the mechanisms of aerosol chemical reactions but also suggest that this new method could transform the future of chemical manufacturing. With this innovative synthesis approach, we look forward to opening a new chapter in chemical synthesis, especially in terms of efficient and environmentally friendly synthesis strategies.</p>

<p>Over the past three months, I have had the privilege of being guided by Dr. Hessam Mehr, which has allowed me to rediscover the field of organic synthesis from an aerosol perspective. Without his guidance, I would not have been able to complete this complex project. Dr. Mehr&#8217;s extensive knowledge in organic chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and software programming has been immensely beneficial to me. His expertise not only helped me address various challenges in the laboratory but also greatly broadened my academic horizon. Working with him has been a highly enjoyable and fruitful experience, deepening my understanding of chemical research.</p>



<p>I sincerely thank Dr. Hessam Mehr for his meticulous guidance and selfless assistance, and I hope to have the opportunity to collaborate with him again in the future. I would also like to express my gratitude to the other members of the Hessam group. I am particularly thankful to Zhang Luokun for his significant help with modeling the vial holder, Ms. Mariam Kalathil for her support in carrying out the experiments, and fellow student Chen Junyi for his valuable writing advice. Their assistance has been crucial to my research work.</p>

<p>We are delighted to welcome Josu to the group. Josu is visiting us from the Public University of Navarre (UPNA)&#8217;s celebrated <em><a href="https://upnalab.com">UPNALAB</a></em> group, well known for their creative solutions touching human-computer interaction, different domains of engineering, physics, and yes, chemistry. He will be staying with us until early July as he looks at the possibilities of controlling chemicals using sound waves.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">More about Josu</h3>



<p>¡Hola!</p>



<p>My name is Josu Irisarri and I came from Spain as a visiting researcher to learn about sound chemistry and aerosols within my 3rd PhD year. I’m really grateful for having the opportunity of sharing science, time and passion in Mehr research group at the Advance Research Center (ARC) of the University of Glasgow. I got in touch with Hessam Mehr after he came to Pamplona to visit our laboratory (<a href="https://upnalab.com/">UPNALAB</a>). I was later invited to an <a href="https://mehr-research.science/2024/a-sounding-board-for-future-chemistry-sound-chemistry-retrospect/">acoustic chemistry workshop</a> <a href="https://sounds-chemistry.science">at Glasgow</a> where I could present my research work of the past years. After that, I got on board into this lovely journey.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_4263-scaled-e1716571230242.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-629"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The UPNALAB crew wowed Hessam with their fascinating research projects last year.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This experience will be crucial not only for my personal career but also for developing my transversal skills, such as, multicultural communication or networking. Here in the ARC there are researcher from many different countries all around the world with whom I’m always enjoying good conversations.  My current main interests are in human computer interaction and contactless haptics and I’m willing to spread my maker and technical knowledge among this laboratory family.</p>

<p>Taking black coffee with hot milk in a glass with ice cubes is my favourite activity when sited on a terrace surrounded by friends and sunny nice day. You can find me hiking the highest mountains of Scotland or visiting the mysterious lakes and islands around. Sometime I like to stop for local beer and food or trying to pronounce right the Scottish accent with words like “Hiya”, “Awright”, “Wee”, “Hapnin” or “Edinbruh”. The climate isn’t the best, although since I’m here it is mainly sunny. They say that I have brought the good weather somehow.</p>



<p>¡Hasta la vista!</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Jakub Wosik and I’m a BSc Chemistry (Hons) student just finishing up my fourth year here at the University of Glasgow.</p>



<p>Last summer I was faced with the decision of what subfield of Chemistry my final year project was going to revolve around. Following a six-week summer internship in the Complex Chemistry labs of the University’s Advanced Research Centre (ARC), I was particularly keen about the possibility of tackling areas that deviated a bit more from our base curriculum or areas that one may initially associate with the field of Chemistry. I was eager to witness and understand more about the ever-evolving incorporation of automation and digitisation into the field, and learn some new, relevant skills along the way. As such, I selected “Complex Chemistry” as my top preference for my Honours project and was fortunate enough to join Dr. Hessam Mehr’s research group as a result.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="815" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_20220902_190921-1024x815.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-526" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_20220902_190921-1024x815.jpg 1024w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_20220902_190921-300x239.jpg 300w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_20220902_190921-768x611.jpg 768w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_20220902_190921-1536x1222.jpg 1536w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_20220902_190921-2048x1629.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In Grudziądz, Poland.</figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Brief project background</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-left">My seven weeks in the Mehr Group revolved around the exploration of aerosol microdroplets as a reaction medium for chemical synthesis. The idea behind this stems in part from the successful applications of other departures from traditional “flask-based” synthetic approaches, such as <em>flow chemistry</em> and <em>microfluidics</em>, with their own sets of advantages. The two main incentives for performing chemistry in the aerosol medium, i.e. in “spray” form are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The potential of different chemical pathways/reactivity as a result of substantially confined volumes — <em>reaction acceleration</em> in microdroplets has been a prominent observation in literature.</li>



<li>Performing chemistry within this medium is inherently “stochastic&#8221;. Is there potential for novel pathways for a given set of chemical building blocks based on the probabilistic nature of droplet interactions within an aerosol cloud?</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">My experience</h3>



<p>More specifically, my experience in the lab was very much focused on demonstrating the feasibility of some known organic reactions via an ultrasonic atomiser-based apparatus for droplet generation. The “reactor” (photographed below) was connected to a computer via a MicroPython circuit, and any chosen reaction was controlled and tuned via a Python program. One thing I very much appreciated and enjoyed was getting to assemble a physical circuit from scratch, coupling it with a script and seeing it all come to life when testing out the spraying of a solvent of choice. Hessam was very helpful and keen to demonstrate processes such as soldering and laser-cutting (for the assembly of the acrylic box, as seen in the photograph), as well as explaining the unfamiliar features of the algorithm and circuitry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_20240130_162144-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-527" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_20240130_162144-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_20240130_162144-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_20240130_162144-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_20240130_162144-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_20240130_162144-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ultrasonic atomiser set-up for a three-solution (ternary) reaction in the aerosol medium.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The biggest challenge within the project certainly had to do with my choice to explore <em>organic reactivity</em> in the medium, coupled with our primary method of droplet detection — <em>microscopy</em>. The droplets generated during a given aerosol reaction were allowed to settle onto a glass slide for visualisation under a Raspberry Pi-based RGB microscope. A reaction is deemed to have proceeded if distinct reagent and product droplets can be identified. This distinction is typically attributed to a <em>significant difference in colour</em> between the two — something that organic chemistry is not particularly known for. As such, my resilience was certainly tested when scouring the lands for an organic reaction that would undergo a distinct colour change in a reasonable timeframe under mild conditions. What this meant was that the eventual sight of a beautiful contrast between distinct red/orange and colourless droplets following an ado-dye synthesis in the aerosol medium put a big smile of excitement and relief on my face.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="840" height="1024" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JW-14c-2024-01-25_14-08-56-clipped-840x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-532" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JW-14c-2024-01-25_14-08-56-clipped-840x1024.jpg 840w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JW-14c-2024-01-25_14-08-56-clipped-246x300.jpg 246w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JW-14c-2024-01-25_14-08-56-clipped-768x936.jpg 768w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JW-14c-2024-01-25_14-08-56-clipped-1260x1536.jpg 1260w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JW-14c-2024-01-25_14-08-56-clipped.jpg 1469w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Droplets resulting from the synthesis of Sudan I in the aerosol medium.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Nearing the end of my project, with the help of Dr. Mehr’s programming expertise, I had the opportunity to witness the seemingly simple, yet promising potential of changing up the algorithm loop to facilitate multi-step reactivity involving an unstable intermediate, i.e. stoichiometric spraying in a sequential manner, as opposed to the simultaneous spraying of two atomisers as per a simple binary reaction. Starting to see the extent of how such an affordable apparatus could be tailored and fine-tuned through the power of code to facilitate a truly hands-off approach to performing mainstream chemistry in an atypical medium was, needless to say, a very rewarding way to wrap up my project.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Final thoughts; what next?</h3>



<p>It is an understatement to say that I am incredibly grateful to Dr. Hessam Mehr for all the patience and guidance throughout my time here. The group provided me with a refreshing look at a different side of Chemistry that aims to take full advantage of where the world is heading technologically — and it’s doing so with accessibility and ease-of-communication in mind. While my time in the group is now over, with the prospect of exploring various other yet-unclear endeavours, the experience I have gained working in Mehr Research is nothing short of invaluable, and the skills I’ve developed will undoubtedly aid me in any facet of Chemistry, or many other potential career path for that matter.</p>



<p>At the time of writing this post I’m preparing for my final degree exams coming up in just under three weeks, so fingers crossed! What keeps me going are some great destress socials with friends; playing some great games and talking for hours about Japanese animation and graphic novels! Following graduation I hope to take some time to enjoy some lovely (hopefully!) sun with my family in Poland, as well as take my partner around some places she’s not seen there yet!</p>



<p>That’s all, folks!</p>

<p>Hi everyone! My name is Zhang Luokun, a master student of Advanced Functional Materials from the University of Glasgow. I am currently working as an intern in the Mehr research group.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/微信图片_20240313155349-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-314" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/微信图片_20240313155349-1-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/微信图片_20240313155349-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/微信图片_20240313155349-1.jpg 1015w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is me in Glasgow.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Two years ago, I came to Glasgow after finishing my undergraduate studies in China. For my program, I learnt the synthesis technology and characterisation (such as atomic force microscope, transmission electron microscope, etc.) of some popular advanced materials (such as quantum dots, perovskite batteries, etc.), which will be the basis of my research work in the future.</p>



<p>When Hessam pitched the idea of using microdroplets as reactors, I was attracted by this crazy idea, and so embarked on a project to create micron-sized soft materials out of seaweed. This blog post is to share with you why these materials are so interesting and how we hope to use them to make the next generation of chemical containers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What really <em>is</em> a chemical container?</h3>



<p>When it comes to chemical reactions, many people think of two solutions mixed in a beaker or test tube, changing from one colour to another. The function of beakers or test tubes is to isolate the reaction from the environment. As a traditional reaction container, they have the advantages of low price and easy operation, but the disadvantages of only carrying out one kind of reaction at the same time are also obvious. If I need to do four chemical reactions and try five reactant ratios for each reaction, assuming I need 5 mL of reactant for each reaction, then I need 20 beakers or test tubes and 100 mL of reactant solution. This soon starts to become impractical when we need to examine a larger number of reactions and conditions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="719" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fig-2v1-1024x719.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-301" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fig-2v1-1024x719.jpg 1024w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fig-2v1-300x211.jpg 300w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fig-2v1-768x539.jpg 768w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fig-2v1.jpg 1217w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Separtte one container into several parts could make different reactions do at the same time.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps you can say that, under the premise of constant total volume, if the interior of a container is divided into several smaller partitions, the above problem can be solved. This is true and indeed it&#8217;s the design idea behind more modern reaction vessels like 96 well plates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="650" height="650" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-380" style="width:336px;height:auto" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image.jpeg 650w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">96 well plates like the one above have become ubiquitous in the biosciences (<a href="https://www.fishersci.ca/shop/products/nunc-96-well-polystyrene-round-bottom-microwell-plates/12565212">image source</a>).</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can even go above 96 wells and well plates with 384, 1536, and even 12,000 wells are available commercially. However, this idea soon runs into limitations. Not only would tinier wells become prohibitively expensive to manufacture, manually using them would be cumbersome and time consuming, even with the help of automation, such as robotic pipetting machines.</p>



<p>This is where our idea of using aerosols comes in: if we are able to turn individual aerosol particles (each just a few microns in size) into chemical containers, it would provide a fast and easy way to make millions of tiny containers that we would never be able to create manually.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why calcium alginate?</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s look more closely at how exactly we are planning to create our next-generation reaction vessels. In order to build a container around an aerosol particle, the easiest way is to form it within the medium where the reaction will take place, called <em>in situ</em> in chemistry. Can this strategy address the challenge of building microscopic isolated chemical environments?</p>



<details class="wp-block-details has-accent-background-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow" style="border-width:1px;padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--10);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--10);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--10);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--10)"><summary>What does in situ mean?</summary>
<p>The phrase <em>in situ </em>come from Latin, literally meaning &#8220;in its original position or place&#8221;. It can mean &#8220;locally&#8221;, &#8220;on site&#8221;, &#8220;on the premises&#8221;, or &#8220;in place&#8221; to describe where an event takes place and is used in many different contexts.</p>



<p>In chemistry,<em> in situ</em> refers to the formation of an intermediate or catalyst and its direct usage in a subsequent reaction or process without isolating or purifying it.</p>



<p>In related fields like metallurgy, <em>in situ</em> formation of intermediates can be useful as well. For example, if we want to generate TiC particles <em>in situ</em> in an iron alloy, we do not need to directly add TiC particles, but add titanium powder and carbon-containing toner and react them to produce titanium carbide.</p>
</details>



<p>This puts forward new requirements for the chemistry used to form our reaction vessels: the reaction generating the container needs to be robust and reliable (not easily affected by the reaction conditions such as temperature, pH, etc.), and it should be possible for small molecules to enter and leave the container.</p>

<p>In my project, we focused on alginate-based materials to meet this challenge. Alginate is a natural polysaccharide derived from brown seaweed. Due to its unique properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, and the ability to form gels in the presence of divalent cations like calcium, alginate is widely used in various industries, including food, pharmaceuticals, and biomedical applications.</p>



<p>Calcium alginate happens to meet all of the above conditions. It is produced by cross-linking alginate using calcium ions, which works under a wide range of conditions. As a bonus, the soft structure generated this way can be rapidly dismantled in the presence of compounds like ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), so that we can easily release the contents of our container.</p>

<p>In chemistry and biology a cross-link is a bond or a short sequence of bonds that links one polymer chain to another. Cross-linking leads to gel formation, which improves the mechanical strength and stability conpared to uncross-linking solution. The cross-linking is widely applied in drug delivery, tissue engineering, food encapsulation, etc.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How did we do it?</h3>



<p>Usually, calcium alginate is produced by reacting sodium alginate solution with calcium chloride solution. In order to obtain micron-scale calcium alginate, though, we needed to create tiny sodium alginate droplets (smaller than the diameter of a human hair). Obviously, these droplets wouldn&#8217;t be practical to make manually, so we turned to a somewhat unusual method instead: using an ultrasonic atomiser.</p>



<details class="wp-block-details has-accent-background-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow" style="border-width:1px;padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--10);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--10);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--10);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--10)"><summary>What is an ultrasonic atomiser?</summary>
<p>Ultrasonic atomisers are devices that using ultrasonic vibrations to create a fine mist or spray of liquid. They are commonly used in various applications such as humidifiers, medical nebulisers, spray-coating systems, and even in certain types of fuel injectors used in cars.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="832" height="832" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-388" style="width:393px;height:auto" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-6.png 832w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-6-300x300.png 300w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-6-150x150.png 150w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-6-768x768.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ultrasonic humidifiers can make a fine mist of water droplets resembling steam without having to heat water up to its boiling point, so the resulting mist is cool to the touch (<a href="https://www.homeboxstores.com/ae/en/Decor-and-Furnishings/Home-Fragrance/Revitalizers-and-Humidifiers/HOMEBOX-Tranquil-Humidifier---3-3-L/p/162633326">image source</a>).</figcaption></figure>

<p>Here is how our atomiser setup works. First, we have a very cool electronic component called a piezoelectric actuator. What does the actuator do? It moves in response to an electric potential (aka voltage). If we change the voltage very rapidly (say a few hundred thousand times a second), the actuator starts to vibrate fast enough that any liquid that comes into contact with it is smashed into microscopic droplets. Second, we need a way to bring the solution in the bottle to the actuator. For this we use a wick made of cotton. One end of the wick is in contact with the liquid in the bottle and the other end touches the piezoelectric element at the mouth of the bottle. The solution is diffused through the cotton wick to the top. To summarise, when sodium alginate solution is poured into the vial the cotton wick draws it up and brings it into contact with the actuator.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240310_204154-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-305" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240310_204154-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240310_204154-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240310_204154-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240310_204154-1536x1151.jpg 1536w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240310_204154-2048x1535.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The reaction space is filled with microdroplets.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Next, we energise the piezoelectric element. We can control exactly when this happens using a computer program that can be customised according to our experiment. When activated, the actuator undergoes periodic deformation, producing sound wave. But these sound waves are very high in frequency, so we cannot hear them; that&#8217;s why they are called <em>ultrasonic pulses</em>. The overall result is that our sodium alginate solution is broken up into microscopic droplets and ejected upward.</p>



<p>In our experiments, we tried two different methods of preparing calcium alginate. One was to make sodium alginate and calcium chloride solution form droplet, which reacted after collision in the air and collected by glass sheet; The other is to allow a solution of sodium alginate to form droplets, which are collected in a petri dish or beaker containing a solution of calcium chloride. We found that the second method works better when there is no intervention (such as using an electromagnetic field to control the movement of the droplets). This is probably because the likelihood of alginate and calcium droplets colliding in the air is not very large in the first method.</p>



<p>We didn&#8217;t only use sodium alginate and calcium solutions in our experiments. The table below shows some of the other combinations that we tried (there were many many more!). Some of these combinations gave us very interesting results that you can see in the microscopy pictures at the bottom.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Experiment</th><th class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Solution 1</th><th class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Solution 2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">a</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Sodium alginate</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Calcium chloride</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">b</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Sodium alginate + Sodium ferrocyanide</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Calcium chloride + ferric chloride</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">c</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Sodium alginate + Sodium ferrocyanide + Iron oxide particle</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Calcium chloride + ferric chloride</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">d</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Adding EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid) after experiment b</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A list showing some of the solutions that we used for our lab experiments.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Then, we tried to introduce the reaction of iron ions into the formation of calcium alginate reaction vessel to verify that the calcium alginate generated <em>in situ</em> can serve as the reaction vessel. When sodium ferrocyanate solution is mixed with ferric chloride solution, the mixed solution will change from light yellow to blue. We added sodium ferrocyanate solution to sodium alginate solution so that the resulting droplets were a mixture of sodium alginate and sodium ferrocyanate, and a mixture of calcium chloride and ferric chloride was added to the petri dish. At the end of the reaction, the blue droplets can be clearly observed under the light microscope at 5.6 times magnification. This means that the reaction can be carried out in calcium alginate reaction vessels.</p>



<p>The next question that came to our mind was whether we could put anything, such as solid particles, inside our microscopic containers. To see if this was possible, we added iron oxide powder to the above solution of sodium ferrocyanide and sodium alginate. After the reaction, the solid particles can be clearly observed under the optical microscope (see picture <strong>c</strong> below).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fig-1v1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-300" style="width:620px;height:auto" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fig-1v1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fig-1v1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fig-1v1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fig-1v1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fig-1v1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">These images are some of results of our experiments recorded using a microscope attached to a camera. In part (a), you can see the almost colourless calcium alginate in the dotted box. Part (b) shows the result after adding iron reaction, the microdroplets are blue. In part (c), you can see the black dots on the surface of microdroplets, which are the iron oxide particles we added in the alginate solution. Part (d) shows the result after adding EDTA in the calcium alginate droplets.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, we added EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid) to the petri dish after the reaction was completed, and after a few seconds, all the blue products previously appeared disappeared, which means that the cross-linked structure of calcium alginate can be destroyed in a short time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Looking to the future</h3>



<p>Many thanks to Dr. Hessam Mehr for his unwavering support and patient guidance, which enabled me to complete this project. Making tiny chemical containers is a very exciting area of research and we think that we have only begun to scratch the surface in the short period working on this project. We need to try more types of reactions to understand what other unique materials can be made using our aerosol-powered and computer-controlled techniques.</p>



<p>We had to tackle many challenges in this project. For example, when forming sodium alginate droplets, we found that different components of the solution require adjusting parameters such as voltage and frequency, and finding the optimal values seems to be tricky, which is also the challenge of this technology.</p>



<p>These days, I spent the weekends visiting some small towns around Glasgow, and enjoying the beautiful scenery, which always gives me the energy to continue my experiment with the complete enthusiasm when back in the lab.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/微信图片_20240315145443-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-349" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/微信图片_20240315145443-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/微信图片_20240315145443-300x169.jpg 300w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/微信图片_20240315145443-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/微信图片_20240315145443-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/微信图片_20240315145443-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is me in the Oban.</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the same time, this project has allowed me to face everything that happens in scientific experiments with peace of mind. Not all experiments are a success but you can always learn something from each one, and there are always new challenges when you least expect them. I regard this period as a gentle prelude to my future academic life. </p>

<p>Earlier this month I organised my first research workshop. Why did it seem like a good idea; what were the main ideas behind the workshop; and how did it go? Let me share the answers to these questions while my memory is still fresh.</p>



<p>Fellow scientist will be familiar with the perks of our job, the moments of learning, discovery, and sharing that keep us going. Somewhat paradoxically, though, one aspect of academic life that I rarely look forward to is going to conferences.</p>

<p>It may be my short attention span or introverted character, but I&#8217;ve found it difficult to enjoy the prevalent maximalist approach to conferences: hundreds of participants often in cliques, countless hour-long talks across multiple tracks, and sessions fuelled by coffee and stretching into the late evening. I often end up coming back confused and exhausted, only remembering the first keynote perhaps and a couple of awkward nods at coffee break.</p>



<p>When the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) funded my proposal for an  interdisciplinary research workshop, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to channel these conference gripes into a new more minimalist format focusing on a different set of goals:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Small, interdisciplinary crowd:</strong> We wanted to avoid the idea of most participants being nameless strangers to each other. Not only would everyone get to meet each other regardless of their career stage, they would also get a chance to share their unique trajectory.</li>



<li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> No keynotes; everyone given 10 minutes to introduce themselves, with another 10 minutes to pitch an interesting research challenge to the audience or vice versa.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="693" src="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2-1024x693.png" alt="" class="wp-image-372" srcset="https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2-1024x693.png 1024w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2-300x203.png 300w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2-768x520.png 768w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2-1536x1039.png 1536w, https://mehr-research.science/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2-2048x1385.png 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Creating an environment of trust where everyone, specially if they are at a more junior career stage, feels comfortable discussing their research without holding back ideas and questions was on of the goals</figcaption></figure>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Trust:</strong> Having your ideas-in-progress &#8220;scooped&#8221; at conferences is not an unfamiliar experience. Can overlap in research interests be channeled towards collaboration rather than competition?</li>



<li><strong>Looking forward:</strong> Rather than showcasing achievements, we wanted everyone to share just enough of their background and areas of interest to catalyse forging new collaborations and sketching joint projects.</li>



<li><strong>Challenging comfort zones:</strong> Everyone should feel slightly outside the comfort zone of their expertise so the discussion is not dominated by one group or field, and ideas can flow freely. </li>



<li><strong>Removing financial barriers:</strong>  Registration, travel and accommodation expenses often stop students and early career academics from attending. Generous RSE funding allowed us to subsidise their participation resulting in a more even mix of career stages.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Who participated?</h3>



<p>Researchers from 5 European universities came to Glasgow. We also had a good spread of disciplines, including human computer interaction, non-destructive testing, microfluidics, complex systems, physical acoustics, and various flavours of chemistry.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organisation details</h3>



<p>A quick rundown that might be useful for anyone planning a small interdisciplinary academic event:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>RSE Research Workshop application was submitted 28th March 2023 and awarded 8th June 2023.</li>



<li>Before submitting, I spoke to collaborators in Bristol and Pamplona, who kindly agreed to be core participants.</li>



<li>With their input, I made a shortlist of UK and Europe labs that may interface with or be interested in the workshop theme</li>



<li>Initial dates and draft list of participants: October 2023</li>



<li>November and December were busy months, so I only got round to booking rooms in the ARC building in January. It was almost too late but we managed to find rooms/times that worked. <strong>Note to self:</strong> Don&#8217;t underestimate the level of activity in the ARC.</li>



<li>A month before the event, I booked catering via the University. We also booked everyone&#8217;s hotel rooms, which was painless once we had final confirmation from participants.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How did it go?</h3>



<p>To summarise my point of view, this was one of the most fun events that I have ever taken part in. Beyond preparing a brief draft agenda (available <a href="https://sound-chemistry.science/programme/">here</a>), there was very little organisation to do, with just enough structure to set things in motion initially. From the beginning, discussions flowed naturally and everyone seemed bond quickly. The programme was spontaneous and dynamic, without ever feeling chaotic.</p>

What research challenges are you working on? Why are you here and what do you hope to take away from the workshop?</figcaption></figure>



<p>Verbal feedback from participants during the workshop was very encouraging, and our online feedback form was filled with positive comments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Acknowledgements</h3>



<p>This workshop would not have been possible without the Royal Society of Edinburgh&#8217;s Research Workshop grant. Without the RSE&#8217;s reputation and generous financial backing to support us, it is difficult to imagine bring such a diverse crowd of interdisciplinary research leaders to Glasgow.</p>



<p>I would like to thank Prof Bruce Drinkwater and Dr Asier Marzo for their support and advice. Their contributions predate the grant application that made this workshop possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Our latest collaborative output with the Cronin group, codenamed <em>&#8220;Chemputer Optimiser&#8221;</em> is out in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45444-3">Nature Communications</a>. Work on this paper started many years ago while I was still a post-doc in the Cronin group, and continued throughout the pandemic. As expected with an open-ended project like this, we had to stop many times and ask ourselves what exactly the paper should aim to demonstrate and why it would be useful/interesting (a question that comes up time and again in academic research). In this note, I thought it would be worth highlighting one aspect of the project&#8217;s outcomes that may not be directly emphasised in the manuscript.</p>



<p>Optimisation is a big part of what chemists spend their time and energy on, in research as well as industry, so accelerating and automating it is of course quite useful. Extending the XDL chemical programming language for optimisation — in addition to synthesis, which was its initial focus — is another highlight and a development that unlocks new directions for digital chemistry. I want to highlight a third achievement, though: mapping out a path between discovery and optimisation.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever seen an odd trace signal in your crude NMR or a curious m/z in the mass spectrum of your reaction mixture and felt tempted to pick up a magnifying glass and dig deeper, amplify that blip in your spectrum and find out what it really is then you know exactly what I am talking about. If only we knew the right conditions to make enough of the trace impurity and isolate it! The unexpected compound could lead us to a whole new reaction or at least a new compound, and especially because you didn&#8217;t expect to see your impurity in the first place this compound is more likely to be interesting than something you did expect.</p>



<p>It was a great pleasure to be part of the team working on this project between 2020 and 2021. One interesting technical challenge was to automate our Agilent HPLC system so separations could run round the clock without wasting lots of solvent and we came up with a fun hack that I may write about in the future. Conceptually though, building a bridge between discovery and optimisation stands out as the paper&#8217;s most enduring contribution to me.</p>
