## Research
The overarching theme of our research is to re-imagine the experimental approaches in mainstream chemical synthesis and discovery drawing on advances in instrumentation, computational modelling, and artificial intelligence.

## Opportunities
For anyone with an interest in chemistry, computing science, physics, or engineering, I would be very happy to discuss potential post-doc/PhD/MSc supervision, summer placements, or other opportunities. Please note that studentships are generally limited to UK students and options might be limited for non-UK students without independent funding.
